			<h2>Technobabble.</h2>
			<p>The other night, I couldn't get my car to start. I solved the problem by reversing the polarity of the car battery, 
			and routing the power through my satellite dish. The resulting subspace plasma caused a rift in the space-time continuum, 
			which created a quantum tunnelling effect that charged the protons in the engine core, thus starting my car. 
			Child's play, really. As a happy side-effect, I also now get the Spice Channel for free.</p>
