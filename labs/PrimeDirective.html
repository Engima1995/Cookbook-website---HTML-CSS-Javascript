			<h2>The Prime Directive.</h2>
			<p>How stupid is this? <br />Remember when Marvin the Martian was going to blow up the Earth, because it obstructed 
			his view of Venus? And how Bugs Bunny stopped him by stealing the Illudium Q36 Space Modulator? 
			<br />Well, in the Star Trek universe, Bugs would be doing time. Probably in a room filled with Roseanne lookalikes 
			wearing spandex uniforms, walking through doors going WHEET! all day. <br />It would be heck. At least until the Kaboom. 
			The Earth-shattering Kaboom.</p>
