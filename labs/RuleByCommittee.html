			<h2>Rule by committee.</h2>
			<p>Here's the difference between Star Trek and the best SF show on TV last year:</p>
			
			<p>Star Trek:

			Picard: "Arm photon torpedoes!"
			<br />Riker: "Captain! Are you sure that's wise?"
			<br />Troi: "Captain! I'm picking up conflicting feelings about this! And, it appears that you're a 'fraidy cat."
			<br />Wesley: "Captain, I'm just an annoying punk, but I thought I should say something."
			<br />Worf: "Captain, can I push the button? This is giving me a big Klingon warrior chubby."
			<br />Giordi: "Captain, I think we should reverse the polarity on them first."
			<br />Picard: "I'm so confused. I'm going to go to my stateroom and look
			pensive."</p>
