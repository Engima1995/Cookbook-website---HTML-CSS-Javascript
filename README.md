# First Website Design

This is a cookbook project done in University. 

The main concept was to develop a website in HTML and CSS using 3 different stylesheets whilst having the content of the HTML remain the same.

The website should be able to change styles during real time navigation throughout the website by clicking on one of the stylesheet buttons within the website. This is acheived by the use of a Javascript file provided by the Univeristy, the website is then able to remember the styles applied to it through the use of cookies.

The overall development was not ideal due to not having previous knowledge on how to create websites, therefore by default this website is the first ever website I have created.
